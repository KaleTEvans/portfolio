                    <p class='about-text'>I currently work as a Systems Engineer at The Boeing Company. I graduated from the University of Oklahoma
                        in 2019 with a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering, and have remained in Oklahoma for quite some time now.
                        After working in the aerospace industry for a few years, I started to develop a passion for coding in my free time. 
                        I have recently been attending the University of Texas Web Developer Boot Camp with the hope of keeping myself on track
                        to perfect my programming skills and continue learning what I enjoy. Being from the Austin, Texas area, I would like to 
                        find a new job close to home. Outside of my professional life I enjoy playing video games, skiing, and traveling whenever
                        I can afford it!

                        As a full stack web devloper I have a wide range of knowledge in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. While in college, I did a fair amount of
                        work with C++ designing embedded systems, using methods such as state machines. I also have proficiency working with SQL and REST API 
                        databases. I find myself enjoying writing code with node.js, particularly when working with databases and creating algorithms to manipulate
                        the data. I also have a good amount of knowledge when it comes to system architecture, as well as working with several integrated teams 
                        across multiple functions, which is what I have done on the job at Boeing.
